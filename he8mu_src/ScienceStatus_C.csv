Study 1a-1d used sub-samples selected from a same dataset by different criteria.  The exact size of this dataset was not reported in the article. 2. They used HLM to analysis the data for the primary research aim, which is to test whether the context factor would influence the results. They only reported the percentage of how much variance would be explained by the context factor, without reporting other information, such as p values. 3. I didn't include the significance test for demographic variables. Because this study did not test the significance of the primary analysis, so I feel this result may not apply for our study. Also, it compared the results for different studies 1a-1d, but it's hard to include any of these tests in our forms.
